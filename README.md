## My process

### Built with

- HTML and CSS
- Sass

### What I learned

- Sass - this was especially useful for mixins and partials
- Using rem instead of px to adapt to user's choice of default font size
- `<picture>` for responsive image
- CSS logical properties for text-direction-agnostic design.

### Continued development

Continue practicing HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and then learn React and other frontend libraries and frameworks.
